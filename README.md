This repo exists purely to maintain and host a remastered copy of Vaughan
Pratt's original 1973 paper, *Top Down Operator Precedence*. Contributions
are very welcome.

A PDF copy of the original paper was freely available from `hall.org.ua`, but
it recently went offline. Thankfully, it can [still be accessed through to the
Wayback Machine][1].

Maintained by [Carl Smith][2]. Thanks to [Brian Campbell][3], [David Majda][4],
[Corentin Smith][5] and [Brett Handley][6] for their contributions.
