This repo exists purely to maintain and host a remastered copy of Vaughan
Pratt's original 1973 paper, *Top Down Operator Precedence*. Contributions
are very welcome.

A PDF copy of the original paper was freely available from `hall.org.ua`, but
it recently went offline. Thankfully, it can [still be accessed through to the
Wayback Machine][1].

Thanks to [Brian Campbell][2], [David Majda][3], [Corentin Smith][4] and
[Brett Handley][5] for their contributions and helpful input.
